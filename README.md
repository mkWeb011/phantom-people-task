Data Management: The CSV file contains the foundational data for each personâ€™s profile (name, GitHub username, bio, etc.).

Dynamic Routing: The router.php file ensures that URLs like /people/john-doe/ load the correct profile page dynamically based on the CSV data.

GitHub Integration: We fetch additional information (like the repository count and follower count) for each person using the GitHub API.

Profile and Directory Pages: We use template-profile.php for individual profiles and template-people-directory.php for the directory page that lists all people in a grid.

SEO and Discoverability: A custom sitemap.php file ensures all profile pages are indexed by search engines.

Error Handling: The project includes error handling for invalid slugs and missing CSV data, ensuring a smooth user experience.
